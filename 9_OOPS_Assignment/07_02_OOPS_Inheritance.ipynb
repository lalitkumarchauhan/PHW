    "#### Inheritance is a object oriented programming concept which helps a child class get access or inherit the properties and method of the parent class. There can be multiple scenarios in which inheriting properties of a particular class are needed to be done. Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class. Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class. Inheritance provides code reusability to the program because we can use an existing class to create a new class instead of creating it from scratch. There are different types of inheritance: Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, Multilevel Inheritance, Hierarchical Inheritance, and Hybrid Inheritance."

To explicitly invoke the constructor of the parent class from the constructor of the child class, the super() function is used.

By defining an abstract base class, you can define a common Application Program Interface(API) for a set of subclasses. It declares the methods but doesnot provide the implementation in python. It is quite useful when third party is involved into the project. Also, if the project is large and involves multiple coding stakeholders, abc is useful and can help unnecessary complications while getting a result as it makes the classes independent with each other and does remove the mix-up. The different modules inherit the basic structure and can work independently, i.e. each class inherits its properties from the parent class which has only declaration and no implementations by overriding the methods easily and maintaining the divide-conquer methodology.\n",

    "#### An \"is-a\" relationship is used to model inheritance or specialization, where a subclass is a more specialized version of a superclass. It signifies that an object of the subclass can be treated as an object of the superclass. In the below example #1, Dog and Cat are subclasses of the Animal superclass. They inherit the speak method from Animal but provide their own implementations, which is a common example of an \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A \"has-a\" relationship is used to model composition, where one class contains an instance of another class as an attribute. It signifies that a class \"has-a\" relationship with another class as a part of its composition. In example #2, a Car class has a \"has-a\" relationship with an Engine class. The Car class contains an instance of the Engine class as an attribute, which represents a \"has-a\" relationship. This allows the Car object to access and use the methods and attributes of the Engine object."
