    "#### In a simple manner, encapsulation can be called as analogous to encryption or black box in which the outer world doesnot know what lies inside the object except the maker of the object, in this case, it is a coder or a programmer. Encapsulation is used to prevent user from getting into unnecessary details which might imapct their interests in using the product as it is not a concern for them. The concept of private , protected variables is the very basis of the object oriented programming. It helps in showcasing only those entities which are required by the end-users. The data is hidden and the functions or methods can be accessed by the programmer-given functions and not directly as in case of public methods. Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) that promotes the idea of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called a class."

    "#### Encapsulation enforces data protection and access control, making it an essential concept in designing modular and maintainable software. Access control is the mechanism that defines the visibility and accessibility of the class's members (attributes and methods). Encapsulation allows you to specify who or what code can access and modify the internal components of a class. Data hiding, also known as information hiding, is the practice of encapsulating the internal state of an object and allowing controlled access to that state through well-defined interfaces (methods). The primary purpose of data hiding is to prevent the direct modification of an object's internal data from outside the class."
