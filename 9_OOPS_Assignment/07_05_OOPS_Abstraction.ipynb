    "#### Abstraction is the concept in Python is by which a complex blueprint of a project can be defined in a easiest possible and modular manner so that smaller parts of the project follows the bigger part in an orderly fashion. The abstraction defines the high level objects for the assignment without any implementation and as bare as possible and the derived class can have methods over-riding the parent methods if needed. This concept leads to the easiness by which the different aspects of a poroject can be tied together and can almost stand against the complexities of the potential problems a project may have if a single ingterface is used to build upon one. For example, a project can have different aspects like Networking module, Storage module etc. A common class can hold them together to prevent the mismatch in the situation where any module(s) are to be updated independently."

    "#### An abstract class can be considered a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class that contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. While we are designing large functional units we use an abstract class. When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component, we use an abstract class. By default, Python does not provide abstract classes. Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC. ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as an abstract and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base. The below code defines an abstract base class called “book” using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module in Python. The “book” class has an abstract method called “subject” that needs to be implemented by its subclasses. There are three subclasses of “book” defined: “data_science,” “dsa,” and “probability.” Each of these subclasses overrides the “subject” method and provides its own implementation by printing the subject of book it has. Instances of each subclass are created, and the “subject” method is called on each instance to display the subject specific to that book."

    "#### A regular class is a construct that enables us to create our own custom types by grouping together variables of other types, methods and events. A class is like a blueprint. It defines the data and behavior of a type. If the class is not declared as static, client code can use it by creating objects or instances which are assigned to a variable. While, Abstract classes, marked by the keyword abstract in the class definition, are typically used to define a base class in the hierarchy. We can't create an instance of them - if done, will get a compile error. Instead, you have to subclass them, and create an instance of your subclass. Abstract classes allow you to provide default functionality for the subclasses. When creating a class library which will be widely distributed or reused—especially to clients, we can use an abstract class, it simplifies versioning. Another benefit of having an abstract base class is if you need to make a change you only need to make it in one place."

An abstract method is one that the interface simply defines. It doesn’t implement the methods. Generally, the interface is not part of Python, but we can implement it using the ABC module. Interfaces play a crucial role in software engineering as they provide a way to define a set of methods or behaviors that a class must implement. As an application grows in size and complexity, it becomes more difficult to manage updates and changes to the code base. One common problem that arises is the presence of classes that have similar functionality but are unrelated in terms of their inheritance hierarchy.

    "#### A prime difference between abstraction and encapsulation is that abstraction hides the complexity of the code, while encapsulation hides its internal functions. Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary information from a user while displaying essential information that is valuable to them. It does not display trivial or non-essential units to the user. By using interfaces and abstract classes, you can accomplish this. A user can only access the methods of an interface. Encapsulation is a feature of OOP that binds data into a single unit called a class. This mechanism provides the ability to hide data. From a security point of view, it is also essential. Technically, an encapsulated class serves as a protective shield that prevents other classes from accessing its variables and data.  It is also known as data hiding because the data in a class is hidden from other classes. To encapsulate a class, declare all variable names as private, and implement methods to set and retrieve variable values in the class. \n",

As an alternative way for defining it, Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations. The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view. ADTs provide a level of abstraction from the implementation details of the data. Users only need to know the operations that can be performed on the data, not how those operations are implemented. One can think of ADT as a black box which hides the inner structure and design of the data type."

When applied effectively in large-scale software development projects, abstraction offers numerous benefits, helping developers manage complexity, improve maintainability, and enhance overall productivity. Abstraction allows developers to focus on high-level concepts and hide the intricacies of lower-level components. Abstraction facilitates modular design, enabling software to be divided into smaller, independent modules. This makes it easier to manage and maintain the codebase, as changes or updates can be isolated to specific modules without affecting the entire system. New components or modules can be added without disrupting existing functionality, making it easier to accommodate growth. Abstraction encourages a more structured and consistent coding style.
