    "#### In object-oriented programming languages, object composition is used for objects that have a “has-a” relationship with each other. For example, a mobile has-a battery, has-a sensor, has-a screen, etc. Therefore, the complex object is called the whole or a parent object whereas a simpler object is often referred to as a child object. In this case, all the objects or components are the child objects which together make up the complex object(mobile). The most important advantage is if any changes have to be made in a child class, only the child class can be changed rather than changing the entire parent class. For example, if we want to change the battery class in the mobile object, with the help of composition, the changes are only made in the battery class and the entire mobile object works fine with the updated changes."

    "#### Inheritance is used where a class wants to derive the nature of parent class and then modify or extend the functionality of it. Inheritance will extend the functionality with extra features allows overriding of methods, but in the case of Composition, we can only use that class we can not modify or extend the functionality of it. It will not provide extra features. Thus, when one needs to use the class as it without any modification, the composition is recommended and when one needs to change the behavior of the method in another class, then inheritance is recommended."
